# Introduction to Mathematical Optimisation
**Mathematical optimisation** is a formal framework for determining the best solution to a quantitative decision-making problem by maximising or minimising an **objective function** subject to** a set of constraints**. 
It involves systematically formulating **decision variables**, which represent the controllable degrees of freedom in a system, and constructing objective functions that encode performance metrics such as cost, efficiency, energy consumption, or error. 

Constraints—expressed as equalities or inequalities—capture physical laws, engineering limits, resource capacities, or operational rules that restrict the solution space. The resulting optimisation model typically takes the form of a constrained minimisation (or maximisation) problem, where the feasible region may be convex or non-convex depending on the structural properties of the mathematical expressions involved. 

This formalism provides a rigorous foundation for analysing the existence, uniqueness, and optimality of solutions using tools from calculus, linear algebra, duality theory, and numerical analysis.

Modern optimisation encompasses a spectrum of problem classes, ranging from linear programming (LP) and quadratic programming (QP) to nonlinear programming (NLP), integer programming (IP), and mixed‑integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). Each class requires specialised solution algorithms such as interior‑point methods, branch‑and‑bound, sequential quadratic programming (SQP), augmented Lagrangian methods, or heuristic/metaheuristic techniques for highly non‑convex or combinatorial landscapes. The behaviour of these algorithms is strongly influenced by the problem’s mathematical structure—convex problems guarantee global optimality, whereas non‑convex formulations may exhibit multiple local optima and require sophisticated global-search strategies. Because many engineering, economic, and scientific systems exhibit nonlinear dynamics, discrete decisions, and complex coupling constraints, mathematical optimisation has become indispensable in fields such as power system operation, machine learning, control systems, operations research, and structural design. Its integration with numerical computation and high‑performance computing enables optimisation to serve as a core technology for real‑time decision support and model‑based engineering.
